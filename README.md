Problem Statement 1:
Write a Python program using function concept that maps list of words into a list of
integers representing the lengths of the corresponding words.
Hint: â€‹If a list [ ab,cde,erty] is passed on to the python function output should come as
[2,3,4]
Here 2,3 and 4 are the lengths of the words in the list.

Problem Statement 2:
Write a Python function which takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns
True if it is a vowel, False otherwise.
